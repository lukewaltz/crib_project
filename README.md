Project Topic: 
An app that delegates chores and tasks among housemates, and sends automatic reminders to avoid conflict. 
Also a polling feature for disagreements.

Product Vision: 
For housemates who need to efficiently and effectively communicate chores and tasks around living areas
(trash, organization, and cleaning), Crib is an organization and communication app that encourages good 
communication from housemate to housemate. The key benefit to using our application is its intuitive and 
easy way to delegating and assigning household tasks. Unlike Dwell (the competing app), we also have anonymous 
polls that roommates can vote on so disputes can be settled calmly.
