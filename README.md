Project Topic: 
An app that delegates chores and tasks among housemates, and sends automatic reminders to avoid conflict. 
Also a polling feature for disagreements.

Product Vision: 
For housemates who need to efficiently and effectively communicate chores and tasks around living areas
(trash, organization, and cleaning), Crib is an organization and communication app that encourages good 
communication from housemate to housemate. The key benefit to using our application is its intuitive and 
easy way to delegating and assigning household tasks. Unlike Dwell (the competing app), we also have anonymous 
polls that roommates can vote on so disputes can be settled calmly. 

Contributing: 
If you haven't installed ESLint either locally or globally do so by running npm install eslint in the workspace
folder for a local install or npm install -g eslint for a global install.
Prettier: Install through VS Code extensions. Search for Prettier - Code formatter
Design Standards:
1. React UI componentâ€™s names should be PascalCase.
2. All other helper files should be camelCase. (non-component files)
3. All the folder names should be camelCase.
4. CSS files should be named the same as the component PascalCase. Global CSS which applies to all components should be placed in global.css and should be named in camelCase
5. CSS class names should use a standard naming convention.
6. Use the DRY principle (Don't repeat yourself).
7. Create multiple files instead of writing a big file. (Componentization of code: fix to small functionality for each file)
8. Place all your CSS files in one common folder.
9. Avoid Inline CSS as and when possible (a CSS class should be created when there are more than 2 CSS attributes).
10. Use ESLint to make your code easier to review. Follow strict linting rules. This in turn helps you write clean, consistent code.
11. Review your code before creating a pull request.
12. Name your files logically according to the job that they perform.
13. Destructuring your props is a good way to help make your coder cleaner and more maintainable.
